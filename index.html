            <h2>Who are they?</h2>
    
            <p>The Chainsmokers is one of my favourite bands. Thier vocals are always amazing and i love the flow in their music an American electronic DJ and production duo consisting of Alexander "Alex" Pall and Andrew "Drew" Taggart. 
                They started out by releasing remixes of songs by indie artists. The EDM-pop duo achieved a breakthrough with their 2014 song "#Selfie", 
                which became a top twenty single in several countries. They have won a Grammy award,[3] two American Music Awards,[4] seven Billboard
                 Music Awards and nine iHeartRadio Music Awards.[5] According to Forbes 2019 list of highest paid celebrities, the Chainsmokers were 
                 the highest paid DJs, dethroning Calvin Harris after six years.[6]
    
                Their debut EP, Bouquet, was released in October 2015 and featured the single "Roses" which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
                 "Don't Let Me Down", featuring American singer Daya, became their first top-five single on the Billboard chart and won the Grammy Award for
                  Best Dance Recording at the 59th awards ceremony. Their single "Closer", featuring American singer-songwriter Halsey, became their first 
                  number-one single on the Billboard chart. The duo's second EP, Collage, was released in November 2016. Their debut studio album, 
                  Memories...Do Not Open, was released in April 2017 and topped the US Billboard 200 chart. Their second album, Sick Boy, was released

           his friend quit the group and Pall asked his manager, Adam Alpert, to help him find a new partner.[8] Alpert introduced him to Taggart and the duo

        <h1>Matt Mcguire</h1>
        <p>
          Matt Mcguire, Drummer and Musical Director for The Chainsmokers, is now playing SABIAN Cymbals exclusively. A former member of Bombs Away,
              the 25-year-old Australian drummer has become an online sensation, amassing over 1.3 million subscribers on YOUTUBE. His channel features 
              viral cover videos of tracks by Marshmello, Skrillex, The Weekend, Linkin Park, Twenty One Pilots, and The Chainsmokers. In total, Matt has 
              racked up over 233 million views (and still counting), with 54 of those videos eclipsing the 1 million views mark.

            Earlier this year, the Chainsmokers announced that their “WORLD WAR JOY” North American headline arena tour would begin in early Fall 2019. 
            The 41-city tour launches late September in Cincinnati, OH, making stops in major arenas across the U.S. and Canada before finishing in Vancouver, 
            BC on December 6. Multi-platinum band 5 Seconds of Summer (featured on the Chainsmokers’ latest single “Who Do You Love,”) and pop star Lennon Stella 
            will be joining them for all the dates.

        <h1>Tony Ann</h1>
        <p>
          Like most millennial musicians, 23-year-old Tony Ann sought Internet fame by posting covers on YouTube. As a contemporary writing and production 
          student at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, he would often book practice rooms to arrange piano covers of his favorite pop songs. 
          Little did he know that one YouTube cover would change his life. In March 2016, he recorded and posted a mash-up cover of two of The Chainsmokers’ biggest hits: “Roses” and “Don’t Let Me Down.” He avidly shared the video
 on social media -- going so far as to tag The Chainsmokers’ accounts, as well as Drew Taggart and Alex Pall’s personal accounts -- and though the response 
 from his friends was overwhelmingly positive, the video only garnered a few thousand views. His world was turned upside down, however, when Taggart commented, 
 “This so fire!!!” on Ann’s Instagram video. From there, his wildest dreams became reality.
